* Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server
 with the approval of the resource owner. 
The client uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

* Refresh Tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens. 
Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server 
and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires,

-If access token is invalid, try to update it using refresh token
-if refresh request passes, update the access token and re-send the initial API request
-If refresh request fails, ask user to re-authenticate
